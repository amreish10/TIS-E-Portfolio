## Summary
* I understood Oracle Academy's mission of providing students with free educational resources and professional certification training for Java, the cloud, and artificial intelligence. These certifications help students become more employable due to technological advancements in their sector.

 ## Suggestions for Improvement
 * The presentation was very enlightening, and to make it more engaging, a quick tutorial or a “Quick Start” guide regarding how to immediately gain access to the Oracle Academy portal and start with the first certification module could be a part of it.
