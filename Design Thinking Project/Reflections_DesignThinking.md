## Summary
* By completing these five stages of Design Thinking, I was able to learn how to recognize user pain, such as confusion in multi-story buildings, and come up with a solution for it, and also gain experience with making a non-functional 3D prototype of my "Dynamic 3D Indoor Map Application" idea.

## Suggestions for Improvement
* The project would be improved by conducting more extensive testing with a broader range of users, such as older visitors, to ensure the interface is accessible to everyone.
