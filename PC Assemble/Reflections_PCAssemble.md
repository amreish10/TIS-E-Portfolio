## Summary
* During this practical lab experience, I was able to gain a working knowledge of computer architecture through the installation of the critical components of a computer. This included the installation of the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and storage devices. The value of correct cabling techniques and the steps needed to build a computer was also an area I learned from, which helped to relate the hardware to the programming that I am learning.

## Suggestions for Improvement
* One area where the lab experience could be improved is by allowing for a longer period to cover the troubleshooting section, because this will make sure students to better prepared for the real world. Another area where improvements are necessary is to have newer components for better heat management and power efficiency.
