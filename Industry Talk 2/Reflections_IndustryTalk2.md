## Summary
* I have learned more regarding the six stages of Software Development Life Cycle and “Success Formula,” which is comprised of 40% of their Artificial Intelligence-assisted skill level and 60% of their foundational knowledge. Additionally, I was introduced to the trend of “Agentic Coding,” whereby their Artificial Intelligent assistants help accelerate their repetitive tasks, with human control over their architecture.

## Suggestions for Improvement
* The experience would have been enhanced if a workshop or a demonstration of the effect of an agentic coding assistant like Kesa.ai had been conducted.
