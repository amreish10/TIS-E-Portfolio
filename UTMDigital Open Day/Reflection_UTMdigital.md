# Reflection : UTMDigital Open Day

## Summary
* The Oracle Academy lecture and visit to the D-Ron booth helped me learn about professional certifications in cloud and database technologies, and how AI-powered surveillance systems improve safety on campus. All this has helped me appreciate how industry-standard technologies are preparing students for the competitive tech-driven work environment.

## Suggestion for Improvement
* The experience could be improved by offering live working examples of the Oracle Cloud technology and offering more details on the architectural structure that needs to be used for advanced security systems for AI.

## Personal Opinion 
* It served as a bridge between theoretical concepts learned in the classroom and real-world applications. The usage of AI for public safety and environmental monitoring inspired me to think more deeply about the impact of cloud and security technologies on the development of future smart cities.
